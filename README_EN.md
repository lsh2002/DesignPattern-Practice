# Design Pattern Practice

[中文 README](./README.md)

Hello! Welcome to my design pattern learning repository.

As a developer, a deep understanding and proficient application of design patterns are essential for improving code quality, maintainability, and extensibility. This repository documents my journey as a student, guided by an AI teacher, through hands-on coding exercises for each of the 23 classic GoF design patterns.

I firmly believe that **Talk is cheap, show me the code.** Only by implementing them firsthand can one truly grasp their essence.

## Learning Progress

> Upon completing each pattern, I will update its status here and provide learning notes that include core concepts and code implementations.

### ✔️ Creational Patterns

These patterns provide mechanisms for creating objects, enhancing the flexibility and reusability of existing code.

| Pattern Name | English Name | Status | Learning Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Singleton Pattern** | Singleton | Completed ✅ | [Notes](./src/singleton/remark.md) |
| **Factory Method Pattern** | Factory Method | Completed ✅ | [Notes](./src/factorymethod/note.md) |
| **Abstract Factory Pattern** | Abstract Factory | Completed ✅ | [Notes](./src/abstractfactory/note.md) |
| **Builder Pattern** | Builder | Not Started | - |
| **Prototype Pattern** | Prototype | Not Started | - |

### ◻️ Structural Patterns

These patterns describe how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while maintaining flexibility and efficiency.

| Pattern Name | English Name | Status | Learning Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Adapter Pattern** | Adapter | Completed ✅ | [Notes](./src/adapter/note.md) |
| **Decorator Pattern** | Decorator | Not Started | - |
| **Proxy Pattern** | Proxy | Not Started | - |
| **Facade Pattern** | Facade | Not Started | - |
| **Bridge Pattern** | Bridge | Not Started | - |
| **Composite Pattern** | Composite | Not Started | - |
| **Flyweight Pattern** | Flyweight | Not Started | - |

### ◻️ Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with effective communication and assignment of responsibilities between objects.

| Pattern Name | English Name | Status | Learning Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| **Strategy Pattern** | Strategy | Not Started | - |
| **Template Method Pattern** | Template Method | Not Started | - |
| **Observer Pattern** | Observer | Not Started | - |
| **Iterator Pattern** | Iterator | Not Started | - |
| **Chain of Responsibility Pattern** | Chain of Responsibility | Not Started | - |
| **Command Pattern** | Command | Not Started | - |
| **Memento Pattern** | Memento | Not Started | - |
| **State Pattern** | State | Not Started | - |
| **Visitor Pattern** | Visitor | Not Started | - |
| **Mediator Pattern** | Mediator | Not Started | - |
| **Interpreter Pattern** | Interpreter | Not Started | - |

## How to Use

You can `clone` this repository and review the core concepts and code implementations of each design pattern by looking at the `note.md` or `remark.md` files within each pattern's package.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
```

Looking forward to progressing together!
